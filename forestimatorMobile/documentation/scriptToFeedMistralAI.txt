This is a list of instructions to create a manual for the forestimator application
The output has to be in french.
A latex compatible document ready to compile. completely formatted with a contents table and later also bibliographie.
Dont generate graphics. if you find a includegraphics, then consider that there are screenshots in the same folder than the latex document. Latex should include them into the final text. You can set the width to 0.25 for all graphics.
Icons are also png images. They are located in a separate folder named icons with the latex file. after the  first . is the filename. you can embed them into the text.
Most sections starts with a description of what can be observed at the screen. After that there are specific procedures to do complete tasks with the application. You should seperate them visually by writing the instructions in a box with title.
When you encounter "Warning:" you put the following lines of text into a box just like the Procedure instructions.

Titlepage
 Under the title you can add that the manual has been made by Thierry Thissen and Jonathan Lisein and MistralAi.

You can delete the polygon by pressing the trashcan to the left of the card. You can ask to analyze the polygon on layers you chosed on ouy servers. This only works if you have a polygon smaller than 250 square meters and it is well defines, the sides dont cut each other.
